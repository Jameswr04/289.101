                        <p>Footprints is a game that I was part of making in year 13 business studies. For the game I did the designs for the board cards and pieces using photoshop and then using a laser cutter to cut out pieces. This was part of the Young Enterprise Scheme and from this game, my group won the innovation award for the hutt valley.</p>

                        <p>As part of the level 2 design technology course I had a brief to design and make a mini motorbike. I made an electric bike. Through the process I gained an understanding on the process of designing something like this and then also learned how to manufacture something like this out of steel using a variety of tools.</p>

                        <p>As part of level 3 design technology I designed and manufactured a cereal dispenser. for this project I went through the process of designing the complete prototype from concepts to the final project and using CAD to help with this process. While manufacturing this project I learned how to use a laser cutter and the software needed for it, how to use and program an Arduino and furthered my skills in woodworking.s</p>
